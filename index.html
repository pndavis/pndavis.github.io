I am a software engineer experienced in Python and Java. I spent the last 3 years mentoring college students and providing technical support. I have a passion for designing software with the end-user in mind to improve the ways we relate to one another. I'm looking for a professional opportunity to combine my programming and relational skills.

My current project is web app to find movie showtimes called [Theatrically](pauldavis.io/theatrically).
