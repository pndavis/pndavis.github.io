Paccar Science Center Imax: If you want to see something in IMAX, this is the place to go, it's the only true IMAX theater in Seattle. Over the years, the requirements to be an IMAX theater have been watered down, causing many theaters to do a minor conversion where they get a slightly larger screen, move the seats closer to it, and upgrade the sound. This allows them to slap the IMAX logo on it and charge more, and as such these theaters are referred to by some as "liemax". True IMAX has a 1 by 1.43 aspect ratio, but very few theaters that use the name can actually show a movie in this ratio. I got to see First Man at the science center and while most of the film is at a big ratio, the last 17 minutes on the movie are in the full 1.33 glory. The space pod opens and the screen suddenly fills with the whole moon. It's a jaw dropping experience. But unless you went to one of the few true IMAX screens, you would have the same aspect ratio the whole movie.
