A web app to find movies playing in your area. Live at https://theatrically.herokuapp.com/. Source code at https://github.com/pndavis/theatrically. 

This is my current project, and has been inspired by my frustration at how hard it can be to find movie showings for movies that aren't blockbusters.

Problem: There is no good place to see what movies are playing where and when. Movies that aren't blockbusters can go in and out of theaters without you knowing. The release window can be a week or even less. Or your favorite film might make it's way back to theaters and you have no idea. 

Fandango has no good way of checking what exactly is playing. It prioritizes theaters that use their ticketing. Atom tends to be better, but also struggles for theaters that donâ€™t use their ticketing. AMC and Regal lock you into their own apps, and even then, they have very poor search functionality.

Key Features:
* Find movies and showtimes playing in your local theater. Can search in a zip code range and date range. 
* List of all local movies playing with abitlity to sort by title, release year, or runtime. 
* Robust search feature to narrow down showtimes based on title, theater, showtime details, or premium format.
* Showtime page shows all showtimes in a given area and timeframe with ability to sort by title, theater, or time.
* Mobile responsive.

I've made this app because of my own personal frustrations with the movie going experience, and there are a lot of future features I'm hoping to add in.
